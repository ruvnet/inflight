## Traditional vs Event-Driven Architecture

### Traditional Approach
- **Polling Based**: Regular intervals check for updates
- **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication
- **Batch Processing**: Delayed data analysis
- **Fixed Logic**: Pre-defined trading rules
- **Limited Scalability**: Database bottlenecks
- **Higher Latency**: Processing delays

### Event-Driven Benefits
- **Real-Time Events**: Immediate data processing
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking operations
- **Stream Processing**: Continuous analysis
- **Adaptive Logic**: AI-powered decisions
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributed processing
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond responses

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key

## Deployment

### Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our unified setup script:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inflight-agentics.git
   cd inflight-agentics
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The script will guide you through:
- OpenAI API key configuration
- Environment setup
- System deployment
- Health checks
- Access information

### Individual Setup Scripts

For more control, you can use the individual scripts:

- `get_openai_key.sh`: Configure OpenAI API key
  - Guided key acquisition process
  - Format validation
  - Secure storage
  - Configuration backup

- `deploy.sh`: Deploy the system
  - Prerequisite checks
  - Environment setup
  - Service deployment
  - Health monitoring

The script will:
- Check prerequisites (Docker, Docker Compose)
- Set up environment configuration
- Validate OpenAI API key
- Clean up old deployments
- Build and start services
- Monitor service health
- Provide access information

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

   Important: You must provide a valid OpenAI API key in the .env file. The trading service uses OpenAI's API for:
   - Market analysis and decision making
   - Technical indicator interpretation
   - Risk assessment
   - Trading strategy formulation

2. Build and start services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Kafka UI: http://localhost:8080
   - Trading service logs: `docker-compose logs -f trading-service`

### Deployment Status

The deployment script monitors service health and provides status updates:
- ✓ Green checkmarks indicate successful steps
- ! Yellow warnings show important notices
- ✗ Red crosses highlight errors

If services fail to start:
1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs`
2. Verify environment configuration
3. Ensure all ports are available
4. Check system resources

## Service Components

- **Kafka & Zookeeper**: Event streaming infrastructure
  - Fault-tolerant message delivery
  - Automatic topic creation
  - Health monitoring with netcat
  - Configurable retry mechanisms

- **Kafka UI**: Web interface for monitoring
  - Real-time topic monitoring
  - Message inspection
  - Broker metrics visualization
  - Health endpoint monitoring

- **Trading Service**: Main service running the trading agent
  - Producer: Publishes market events
  - Consumer: Processes events and makes trading decisions
  - Agentic Controller: Manages decision-making logic
  - Health checks for Kafka connectivity

## Health Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive health checks for all services:

1. **Zookeeper**:
   - Checks server status with `ruok` command
   - 10-second check intervals
   - 5 retries before failure

2. **Kafka**:
   - Verifies topic listing functionality
   - Waits for healthy Zookeeper
   - Includes netcat for network checks
   - Automatic retry on failure

3. **Kafka UI**:
   - Monitors web interface health endpoint
   - Includes wget for HTTP checks
   - Waits for healthy Kafka
   - Automatic recovery

4. **Trading Service**:
   - Verifies Kafka connectivity
   - Python-based socket checks
   - Configurable retry settings
   - Automatic dependency management

## Configuration

Key configuration options in `.env`:
```
KAFKA_BROKER_URL=kafka:9092
KAFKA_TOPIC=market-events
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

See `.env.example` for all available options.

## Development

For local development:

1. Update `.env`:
   ```
   KAFKA_BROKER_URL=localhost:9092
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Run services separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start Kafka infrastructure
   docker-compose up kafka zookeeper kafka-ui

   # Terminal 2: Run consumer
   poetry run python run_consumer.py

   # Terminal 3: Run producer
   poetry run python run_producer.py
   ```

## Example System Responses

### Code Analysis Response

When analyzing code issues, the system provides structured responses:

```python
# Input: Code with missing colon
def calculate_total(prices)
    return sum(prices)

# System Response:
{
    "action_type": "FIX",
    "details": {
        "analysis": "Missing colon after function definition",
        "solution": "def calculate_total(prices):\n    return sum(prices)",
        "explanation": "Python requires a colon after function definitions",
        "best_practices": "Always include colons after function/class definitions"
    },
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "steps": [
        "Add missing colon after function parameters",
        "Verify indentation of function body"
    ]
}
```

### Trading Decision Response

When analyzing market conditions, the system provides detailed trading decisions:

```python
# Input: Market Event
{
    "asset": "BTC/USD",
    "price": 42150.75,
    "indicators": {
        "rsi": 67.8,
        "macd": {
            "value": 145.2,
            "signal": 132.8,
            "histogram": 12.4
        },
        "sentiment_score": 0.82
    },
    "market_context": {
        "trend": "bullish",
        "volatility": "medium"
    }
}

# System Response:
{
    "action_type": "BUY",
    "details": {
        "asset": "BTC/USD",
        "price": 42150.75,
        "size": 0.5,
        "reasoning": "Strong bullish signals with RSI below overbought, positive MACD histogram, and high sentiment score"
    },
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "risk_assessment": "Medium - Controlled position size with stop-loss recommended",
    "steps": [
        "Execute market buy order for 0.5 BTC",
        "Set stop-loss at 41000.00",
        "Monitor RSI for overbought conditions"
    ]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/
```

Run specific test scenarios:
```bash
poetry run python test_trading_agent.py
```

## Monitoring

- Use Kafka UI (http://localhost:8080) to:
  - Monitor event flow
  - Inspect message contents
  - Track consumer group status
  - View broker metrics

## Troubleshooting

1. If services fail to start:
   - Check if ports 2181, 9092, or 8080 are in use
   - Ensure Docker has enough resources
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

2. If trading service isn't processing events:
   - Check Kafka UI for topic creation and messages
   - Verify OpenAI API key is valid
   - Check service logs for errors
